<p>
    <ul>
        <li>A shared worker is running in its own thread.</li>

<h2>How to</h2>
<p>
    The folder <code>PROJECT/backend</code> inside your Wakanda project is where you usually use a shared worker.
</p>
<p>
    It is composed of:
    <ul>
        <li>A worker running in its own thread.</li>
        <li>A proxy that helps you to communicate with the worker.</li>
    </ul>
    Here is a code example:

<p>
    You can require :
    <ul>
        <li>
            Wakanda modules (defined in <code>PROJECT/backend/modules</code>)
        </li>
    </ul>
